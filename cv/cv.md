# Summary

Computer Scientist (MSc ETH Zürich) that gets things done.™ Extensive experience designing code and processes in big companies and startups.
I enjoy finding solutions that are as simple as possible, but no simpler. Always looking to put a dent in the universe.

# Employment

### Since 2023: CTO [Spatz](https://www.spatz.news) (formerly Polaris News), Zürich, Switzerland

- Startup building a user-generated hyper-local news platform.
- Hired part of the team. We followed the lean startup methodology, rapid prototyping, user-centered design, business model generation, etc. Implemented MVP using Astro, SolidJS, Supabase and Render.

### 2019-2023: Technical team lead front-end at [Tamedia](https://www.tamedia.ch), Zürich, Switzerland

- Tamedia is one the largest media groups in Switzerland. As the technical team lead for the web front-ends and native apps, my team of 11 developers was responsible for the platform delivering 13 websites, including [www.tagesanzeiger.ch](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch). Our frontend service handles a sustained load of 150'000 requests/min, with peaks exceeding 500'000. We have a modern CI/CD workflow with feature-branch-deployments, and auto-deployment to production as soon as a feature is merged.

- I helped grow the skill-sets of my team members, and by building trust, significantly improved communication and processes between various teams and stakeholders. One of the first things I did was to move our team and our Next.js codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript. One of the last things was to move the development of our native apps in-house; hired one iOS and one Android dev, re-architected the apps as hybrid apps (Swift/Kotlin plus WebViews) and as promised, launched within a year.

### 2018-2019: Software engineer at _[Fision Technologies](https://web.archive.org/web/20191225205351/https://www.fision-technologies.com/)_ (since acquired by Zalando), Zürich

- Fision Technologies is a startup with at that time around 20 employees. The product is a mobile app and accompanying back-end. End-users use the app to take photos of their body, from which a 3D-model is constructed, which is used to give size-recommendations for clothes when online-shopping on one of our customers' online stores.

- I was working on both the front-end (React, TypeScript, GraphQL) and the back-end services. The latter were implemented using Python (Falcon and SQLAlchemy), exposed as REST APIs and ran on Google's Kubernetes Engine.


### 2015-2018: Co-founder and full-stack developer of [2324.ch](https://2324.ch), Zürich

- My co-founder (a graphic designer) and I won an Impact Hub Zürich Fellowship with the idea of 2324.ch – a participatory hyper-local online news-platform. We quickly on-boarded a marketing/sales guy and soon acquired four paying municipalities. Unfortunately, that was not enough to sustain our growth vision, so we decided to hand-over the project and our customers to Crossiety, a startup sharing our vision of an online village square.

- In addition to forming our team and product strategy, I implemented both front- and back-end of the online platform. My decision to go with a simple and proven stack (Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and some React) served us well, and allowed us to quickly iterate on the product.

### 2017-2018: Haskell developer for [qua-kit](https://github.com/achirkin/qua-kit), Chair of Information Architecture, ETH Zürich

- In my part-time work, I supported Artem Chirkin, then a PhD student, in continuing the development of qua-kit, a web-based platform that assists urban designers in their design process.

- I worked on both the front- and back-end, which were implemented using [Reflex](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex) (a functional reactive programming framework on GHCJS) and [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com) respectively.
