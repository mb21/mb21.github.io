# Employment

### Since 2019: Team Lead at [TX Group](https://tx.group) (formerly [Tamedia](https://www.tamedia.ch)), Zürich, Switzerland

- TX Group is the largest media group in Switzerland. As team lead for the web front-ends of the newspapers with a subscription business model, our team of nine developers is responsible for twelve websites, including [tagesanzeiger.ch](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch) and [derbund.ch](https://www.derbund.ch/). We handle a sustained load of 150'000 requests/min, with peaks exceeding 300'000.

### 2018-2019: Software engineer at _[Fision Technologies](https://fision-technologies.com)_, Zürich

- Fision Technologies is a startup with at that time around 20 employees. The product is a mobile app and accompanying back-end. End-users use the app to take photos of their body, from which a 3D-model is constructed, which is used to give size-recommendations for clothes when online-shopping on one of our customers' online stores.

- I was part of the seven-people platform-team, that was tasked with continuously delivering the software into production. I was working on both the front-end (React, TypeScript, GraphQL) and the back-end services. The latter were implemented using Python (Falcon and SQLAlchemy), exposed as REST APIs and ran on Google's Kubernetes Engine.


### 2015-2018: Co-founder and full-stack developer of [2324.ch](https://2324.ch), Zürich

- My co-founder (a graphic designer) and I won an Impact Hub Zürich Fellowship with the idea of 2324.ch – a participatory hyper-local online news-platform. We quickly on-boarded a marketing/sales guy and soon acquired four paying municipalities. Unfortunately, that was not enough to sustain our growth vision, so we decided to hand-over the project and our customers to Crossiety, a startup sharing our vision of an online village square.

- In addition to forming our team and product strategy, I implemented both front- and back-end of the online platform. My decision to go with a simple and proven stack (Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and some React) served us well, and allowed us to quickly iterate on the product.

### 2017-2018: Haskell developer for [qua-kit](https://github.com/achirkin/qua-kit), Chair of Information Architecture, ETH Zürich

- In my part-time work, I supported Artem Chirkin, then a PhD student, in continuing the development of qua-kit, a web-based platform that assists urban designers in their design process.

- I worked on both the front- and back-end, which were implemented using [Reflex](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex) (a functional reactive programming framework on GHCJS) and [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com) respectively.
